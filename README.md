# Finding Last Monday

lastMonday function will return the date of the last Monday from the date of reference, `baseDate`, passed as argument 
and return it in string form (i.e. `Mon Dec 18 2017`).

Uses Jasmine to test the function. To see test results, `git clone` this repo, and open up `SpecRunner.html` in your 
browser.

**Notes**:
1) I'm also testing `helloWorld` and `getDaysBetweenTodayAndADate` functions to familiarize myself with the 
Jasmine matchers/assertions.
2) The Jasmine testing was inspired from udacity's "JavaScript Testing" course. See repo [here](https://github.com/udacity/ud549).
